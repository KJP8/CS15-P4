## Description
This application allows a user to sign up/log in to access their own personal grocery list. They can add (Create) foods to their grocery list, edit (Update) names of foods in their grocery list, delete (Delete) from from their grocery list, and simply view (Read) their grocery list. As an added bonus, when a user adds a food to their list, the application calls an API that will retrieve the nutrition information about the food the user has added and will then render that information to the user's screen. Logged in users can also view all other users' grocery lists.
